# Clean Code Principles 
## 1.SOLID: This acronym stands for Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle. These principles help to ensure that code is modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.

## 2.Keep it simple, stupid (KISS): This principle emphasizes the importance of simplicity in code. Complex code can be difficult to understand and maintain, so it's important to keep things as simple as possible.

## 3.Don't repeat yourself (DRY): This principle encourages developers to avoid duplicating code. Repeating code can lead to errors and make the code more difficult to maintain.

## 4.Separation of concerns (SoC): This principle encourages developers to separate different parts of the code into separate modules or classes, each responsible for a single concern.

## 5.Single responsibility principle (SRP): This principle states that each module or class should have a single responsibility or reason to change. This helps to ensure that code is modular and easy to maintain.

## 6.Open/closed principle (OCP): This principle states that modules or classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that new functionality can be added without changing existing code.

## 7.Liskov substitution principle (LSP): This principle states that subclasses should be substitutable for their superclass. This helps to ensure that code is flexible and can be easily extended.

## 8.Interface segregation principle (ISP): This principle states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This helps to ensure that code is modular and easy to maintain.

## 9.Dependency inversion principle (DIP): This principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but instead both should depend on abstractions. This helps to ensure that code is flexible and easy to maintain.

## 10.Law of Demeter (LoD): This principle states that modules or classes should only communicate with their immediate neighbors. This helps to ensure that code is modular and easy to maintain.

## 11.Composition over inheritance: This principle states that code should favor composition over inheritance, as composition is more flexible and easier to maintain.

## 12.Minimize coupling: This principle encourages developers to minimize the dependencies between modules or classes. This helps to ensure that code is modular and easy to maintain.

## 13.Maximize cohesion: This principle encourages developers to maximize the coherence within modules or classes. This helps to ensure that code is modular and easy to maintain.
